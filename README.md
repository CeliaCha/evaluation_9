## **Exercice**

Today I would like to present the project I contributed to with the three other members of my team at the St-Gaudens game-jam. The aim of the project was to create a game that could encourage the children and teenagers of St-Gaudens to discover their city. We chose to develop a prototype of a mobile game treasure hunt on the map of the city,  with multiple points localized on its historical places. The purpose of the game was to collect virtual rewards by correctly answering the questions associated with each place.

We had only two days to develop a demo version, so we chose to use only front-end technologies. The logic of the app was handled by Vue.js framework and we used Leaflet API to display the map. The most important challenge was to implement the geolocalisation functionality, which none of us had ever used. In the end, I was surprised by the relative simplicity of the JavaScript geolocalisation API and the fact that we made it work. As for me, I worked mainly on Vue.js components, often in pair-programming, and contributed to conceive the architecture of the project.
